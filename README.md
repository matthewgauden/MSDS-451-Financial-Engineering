# MSDS-451-Financial-Engineering

## Intro
The goal of Programming Assignment 1 was as follows: The first programming assignment builds on an example financial time series. Jump-start code shows how to construct features from a time series of daily prices with the objective of predicting returns for the next day. We demonstrate feature engineering, feature selection, and cross-validation methods. 

## Guide
In the repository for assignment 1, you can find the Jupyter Notebook .ipynb file that includes the jump-start code. In this file, there does not need to be any alterations made if you deem it unnecessary. The only thing that needs to be changed is the ticker/symbol. For me, I evaluated The Walt Disney Co. (DIS), separate from the initial WTI. 

You will also find the pdf of my technical report which succinctly summarizes and analyzes my findings with Disney. 

## Build Steps
The jump-start code should be able to run as is. The only obstacle you may encounter is the sheer amount of Python libraries and packages being used for the models. For me this was not an issue, but it may cause space and memory issues if you download a lot of software onto your computer. To combat this, it may be helpful to download and install Docker Desktop. Docker is able to hold all of the packages required to do the work for this assignment in its own container without taking up space on your personal computer.
